# Streak Calendar

Streak Calendar is an open source productivity tool that combines habit tracking, task timing, and progress visualization. It supports multiple calendars and habits, allowing you to customize your approach to personal growth. Featuring an activity grid similar to GitHub's contribution tracker, it offers a clear view of your achievements over time.

This project is currently in its experimental/alpha stage and is solely developed by me. Any feedback, contributions, or support would be greatly appreciated as I continue to improve and refine it.
